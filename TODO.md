## Our List
[🕸] audio? <br />
  - Probably Sound Cloud <br />
  https://glitch.com/~soundcloud-waveform<br />
  
[🕸] ! fix rotation coordinate system (switch to quaternion) <br />
[🕸] figure out how we are going to interface with the dance krew! <br />  
  -color?<br />
  -movement?<br />
  -camera placement<br />
  -what will they be dancing to?<br />
  
[🌝]! Start receiving updated shader code
[🕸]! performance issues <br />
  - glitch uses up a bunch of CPU when loading the editor while someone is browsing [SERVER]
  - socket performance [SERVER]
  - is the scene being re-created too much? [CLIENT]
  - what happens if server gets restarted or something? [SERVER] [CLIENT] 

[🕸]! Make sure editor is reflective of what is happening on people's cameras...or something <br />
  - I'm thinking about u_camPos and how we use that<br />
  
[🕸] which mobile browsers do and don't work. Androiddd<br />
  - check and update BROWSER-INFO.md 
  
[🕸] Explore some of the creative possibilities once the tech is feeling stable<br />

[🌝] Add Three.js<br />
[🌝] Add [html editor](https://github.com/mrdoob/htmleditor) from Mr.doob <br />

### Chirag
[🌝] Create a way to have multiple live coders <br />
[🌝] Update the shader when a live coder makes a change <br />
[🌝] Make changes to the htmleditor
  - [🌝]live coding action
  - [🌝]send the shader code to the server
  
  notes: 🌝
 * remove concept of users and assume single computer will edit shader
 * remove registration page
 * concert needs to subscribe and print out updates
 * update the actual shader
  
# lets not worry about this for our show on sat
[🕸] Keep track of `which` shader the user is looking at <br />
